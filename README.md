A Google Chrome extension with the sole purpose of adding copy-and-paste functionality to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) on your Chrome browser. It provides a critical feature that enables users to easily upload images from their clipboard with a simple ctrl+c and ctrl+v operation, eliminating the tedious task of saving and manually uploading images. With OverleafCopyAndPaste, you can focus more on your content and less on the process, enhancing productivity and efficiency when using Overleaf.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality

One of the most frustrating aspects of creating documents or reports on Overleaf is the lack of a simple clipboard upload feature.
Resulting in that when you need to upload a picture and you use a cutting tool for capturing the image, you can't upload it directly using the CTRL+V shortcut.
Instead, you manually have to save the picture and drag 'n drop the picture onto Overleaf to upload the picture.
This short but very needed functionality will allow you to paste images from your clipboard easily with just a click of a button.

**üì∏ Demonstration** Here is a gif of me taking a screenshot and using `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+v` to paste it into my assets folder

<img src="/images/how_to_use.gif" style="width:700px;" alt="functionality gif"/>

**üåÄ Very flexible**
At present, this extension operates by accessing your clipboard data, which offers highly flexible functionality. For example, you're able to select specific areas within images, simply press ctrl+c to copy, then paste into Overleaf with ctrl+v, resulting in only your selected area being transferred. A demonstration GIF will be provided soon.

## üîß How to install

The installation only takes around 20-25 seconds, so what are you waiting for? Go to [releases](https://github.com/simonsejse/OverleafCopyAndPaste/releases) and download the newest stable version. If you're looking to further develop head to the **üë®‚Äçüíª How can I contribute?** section.

**üì∏ Installation** Here is a gif provided of me installing the extension from the release files.

## üìÅ Folder extensions supported

The folders currently supported in the Chrome Extensions are the following below in the same priority order. That means you just have to have one of the following folders created inside your overleaf project and the extension will find one of these folders by itself.

https://github.com/simonsejse/OverleafCopyAndPaste/blob/437e795c640f83927ad504075c4b67b876e9fb26/src/imageProcessor.js#L17-L30
