# OverleafCopyAndPaste
A Google Chrome extension with the sole purpose of adding copy-and-paste functionality to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) on your Chrome browser.

## Functionality
One of the most frustrating aspects of creating documents or reports on Overleaf is the lack of a simple clipboard upload feature. 
Resulting in that when you need to upload a picture and you use a cutting tool for capturing the image, you can't upload it directly using the CTRL+V shortcut. 
Instead, you manually have to save the picture and drag 'n drop the picture onto Overleaf to upload the picture. 
This short but very needed functionality will allow you to paste images from your clipboard easily with just a click of a button.

## How to install
I don't even know yet, not finished it.

## Backlog
- [ ] Add functionality to paste all kinds of files, currently only image extensions are accepted.
